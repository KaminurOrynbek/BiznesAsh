## Project Overview  üìå

In Kazakhstan, youth and returning migrants are increasingly interested in launching private businesses. However, navigating business registration (e.g., opening an –ò–ü or –¢–û–û) is often confusing and time-consuming due to fragmented information spread across:

- [egov.kz](https://egov.kz)
- [atameken.kz](https://atameken.kz)
- Social media
- Informal communities

BiznesAsh solves this by centralizing business-starting knowledge in a structured, localized, and community-driven platform.
